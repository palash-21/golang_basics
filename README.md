Golang intro:

# Development
-Go language is a general-purpose language, designed with systems programming in mind, initially developed at Google in the year 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.

-Go is a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.

-Syntax is similar to C++. 

# Features
-Support for environment adopting patterns similar to dynamic languages.
-Fast compilation and runtime.
-Inbuilt concurrency support( go routines), channels, select statement.
-Support for Interfaces and Type embedding.
-Production of statically linked native binaries without external dependencies.
-Has automatic garbage collection.
-Has memory management.
Details:
-As programs run they write objects to memory. At some point these objects should be removed when theyâ€™re not needed anymore. This process is called automatic memory management. This this is implemented in Go by using a garbage collector
-Similar to memory management in python, there are two memory locations heap(for objects outside a function) and stack(for objects inside a function)
-In manual memory management, function is call to manually write an object to memory and another function to free memory.

# X-- Features excluded intentionally --X
-Type inheritance
-Method or operator overloading (operator overloading means same operator has multiple uasge eg. + will add numbers,string,list,etc)
-Circular dependencies among packages
-Pointer arithmetic
-Assertions (eg. in python the assert keyword lets you test if a condition in your code returns True, if not, the program will raise an AssertionError.)
-Generic programming
